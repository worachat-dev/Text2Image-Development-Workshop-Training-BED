**Introduction**

This notebook provides a modified version of the Hyper-SDXL text-to-image pipeline originally designed for Stable Diffusion. It allows you to leverage the superior capabilities of Hyper-SDXL for generating high-quality images based on your textual prompts.

**Setup**

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/worachat-dev/Text2Image-Development-Workshop-Training-BED.git
    cd Text2Image-Development-Workshop-Training-BED
    ```
2. **Connect to Google Colab:**
    Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload this notebook.
3. **Run all cells:**
    Click on "Runtime" -> "Run all" to execute all code cells and set up the environment.

**Usage**

1. **Define your prompt:**
    In the designated cell, enter the text description of the image you want to generate. Be as detailed as possible for better results.
2. **Adjust hyperparameters (optional):**
    The notebook provides options to modify hyperparameters like the number of inference steps, guidance scale, and noise level for fine-tuning the image generation process.
3. **Run the generation cell:**
    Execute the cell responsible for generating the image.
4. **View and save results:**
    The generated image will be displayed in the notebook. You can also save it to your local storage using the provided code.

**Customization**

This notebook offers some flexibility for customization. You can experiment with different hyperparameters and explore advanced functionalities depending on your expertise.
